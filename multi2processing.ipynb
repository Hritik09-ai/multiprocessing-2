    "# QUESTION.1 What is multiprocssing in python? Why is it useful?\n",
    "# ANSWER Multiprocession in python is a technique that allows you to create and manage multiple processes concurrently \n",
    "# within a Python program. Each process runs independently and has its own memory space, which enables parallel \n",
    "# execution of tasks. It is usedful for several :\n",
    "# 1.Parallelism: Multiprocessing allows you to leverage the full potential of multi-core processors by running tasks in\n",
    "# parallel\n",
    "# 2.Concurrency: It enables concurrent execution of tasks, which is especially of tasks, which is especially useful for\n",
    "# I/O-bound operations,like reading/writing files or making network requests, as it prevents one task from blocking other\n",
    "# 3.Isolation: Each process has its own memory space, which means that they don't interfere with each other.\n",
    "# 4. Resource Utilization: Multiprocessing helps better utilize system resources. It can maximize CPU usage and improve \n",
    "# overall efficiency of your program.\n",
    "# 5. Task Division: You can divide a large task into smaller sub-tasks and process them in parallel, which can lead to\n",
    "# faster execution times."
